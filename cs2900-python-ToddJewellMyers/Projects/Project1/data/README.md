 I'm using the data set that was offered for the car accidents and weekdays.
https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/crash_catalonia.csv

I got it from the suggested ideas that was submitted 

Two columns are important from this data set the column's day of week and number of crashes.

Looking at the graph we can see that the car crashes in Catalonia from 2000 to 2011 by the day of the week shows that friday has a high number of wrecks comapred to sunday which shows a very low number for car crashes showign sundays are a low accident day and fridays have a high chance for accidents.
